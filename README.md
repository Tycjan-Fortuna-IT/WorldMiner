# Work in progress

**World Miner Mod**

Welcome to the adventurous world of World Miner! Embark on an exciting journey where you'll explore world chunk by chunk, to uncover precious resources, valuable rocks yielding rare ores and lurking dangers. Delve deep into the unknown, mine your way through rocky terrains.

### Works well with combination of Angel's and Bob's mods.

1. **Chunk-by-Chunk Exploration:** The mod introduces a unique gameplay mechanic where you'll explore the world one 'room' at a time.

2. **Valuable Rocks:** Discover special rocks scattered throughout the world that yield valuable resources. Be ready to mine them skillfully to extract the precious ores hidden within.

3. **Dynamic Resource Generation:** Resources, ores, and treasures are dynamically generated, ensuring every new game provides a fresh and unpredictable experience.

4. **Upgrade and Enhance:** collect coins to upgrade your tools and equipment as you progress, making your mining operations more efficient.

### If you like to mine stone extensively this mod is for you.

### Known issues

Some numbers here and there might need to be tweaked. I'm not sure if the mod is balanced enough, it's still in very early stage. I'm open to suggestions.

### Contributing

If you want to contribute to the mod, I would be happy to accept some suggestions and ideas. Use comments here or directly via github's pull requests or issues.
