  Minor Features:
    - Rooms with enemies, ore veins and oil now feel a litle less empty
    - More market items (ore exchange, backpack upgrade, blue coins currency)
    - Rocks now have a chance to drop enemies in different stages of evolution (based on distance from center, can be disabled in settings)
    - Gui can be closed now
    - Banner placeables and items added for future dungeon rooms(different banner for different room type, difficulty, boss, etc...)
    - Variant dispatcher overhaul, now it's more flexible
    - New room variants: 1x2
    - Trees can yield ore (can be enabled in settings)
  Balancing:
    - Less ore from rocks at the begining (now scales better with distance from center)
    - Ore patches richness improved (now scales better with distance from center)
    - Less rocks and trees in 1x1 rooms (you still can have old quantity by enabling `More Rocks` and `More Trees` settings)
